/* TypeScript Introduction
=============================

TypeScript is JavaScript with added syntax for types.


What is TypeScript ?
--------------------
TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which 
adds static typing. This basically means that TypeScript 
adds syntax on top of JavaScript, allowing developers to 
add types.

TypeScript being a "Syntactic Superset" means that it shares 
the same base syntax as JavaScript, but adds something to it.


Why should I use TypeScript ?
------------------------------
JavaScript is a loosely typed language. It can be difficult 
to understand what types of data are being passed around in 
JavaScript.

In JavaScript, function parameters and variables don't have 
any information! So developers need to look at documentation, 
or guess based on the implementation.

TypeScript allows specifying the types of data being passed 
around within the code, and has the ability to report errors 
when the types don't match.

For example, TypeScript will report an error when passing a 
string into a function that expects a number. JavaScript won't.

Note: TypeScript uses compile time type checking. Which means it 
      checks if the specified types match before running the code, 
      not while running the code.


How do I use TypeScript ?
--------------------------
A common way to use TypeScript is to use the official TypeScript 
compiler, which transpiles TypeScript code into JavaScript.

The next section shows how to get the compiler setup for a local 
project.

Some popular code editors, such as Visual Studio Code, have 
built-in TypeScript support and can show errors as you write code! */
